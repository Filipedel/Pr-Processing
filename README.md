# Pr-Processing

For my Internship, i've had to do pre-processing into a database related with Charcot disease. I needed to throw out columns with 90% of missing data. Also I encoded qualitatives variables with One Hot Encoder. In the end, i merged all the Encoded and cleaned databases into one File csv.
