# Pr-Processing

For my Internship, i've had to do pre-processing into a database related with Charcot disease. I needed to delete columns with 90% of missing data. Also I encoded qualitatives variables with One Hot Encoder.I've had to normalize quantitatives variables with the MinMaxScaler to put them into [0,1] scale. In the end, i merged all databases into one File csv.
